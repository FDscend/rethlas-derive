name: propose-subgoal-decomposition-plans
description: Propose multiple subgoal decomposition plans for the current theorem using the information already gathered. Use when enough information has been collected from examples, counterexamples, search results, and previous failures to break the problem into several materially different plans.

# Propose Subgoal Decomposition Plans

Use this skill when the agent has enough context to propose several viable decomposition plans.

## Input Contract

Read:

- the current target theorem or branch goal
- `memory/immediate_conclusions.jsonl`、`memory/toy_examples.jsonl`、`memory/counterexamples.jsonl`
- `memory/failed_paths.jsonl` 与 `memory/branch_states.jsonl`
- `downloads/search_summary.md` 与相关引用

## Procedure

1. Gather the current information that materially constrains the problem: useful examples, failed claims, known obstructions, and relevant search results.
2. Propose materially different decomposition plans.
3. For each plan, state:
   - the main idea of the plan
   - the ordered subgoals
   - why this plan is plausible given the current information
   - which earlier failures or counterexamples it tries to avoid
4. Hand each plan to `$direct-proving` for a quick screening pass.

## Output Contract

Append one record per plan to `memory/subgoals.jsonl`（每行一个 JSON，含 `ts`）：

```json
{
  "plan_id": "...",
  "record_type": "decomposition_plan",
  "goal": "...",
  "plan_summary": "...",
  "subgoals": ["..."],
  "motivation": ["..."],
  "uses_information_from": {
    "examples": ["..."],
    "counterexamples": ["..."],
    "key_failures": ["..."]
  },
  "branch_id": "optional"
}
```
